# LED Bike Vest Using Arduino

Nighttime bicycle riding is risky. Because bicycles lack indicators and lighting, making them 
less safe than trucks, cars, and motorbikes, bicyclists are particularly vulnerable. At night, 
motorists frequently miss bicyclists because they are too busy scanning the road for other 
vehicles. Therefore, accidents become more likely to happen to bikers.

Making yourself as conspicuous as you can when riding a bicycle is the answer. Cycling may 
be made more visible by wearing brightly coloured vests like those used by road construction 
workers.

We developed the "LED Bike Vest," an open-source Arduino turn signal bike safety vest, to 
address this problem. A tool called the Bike Suit is intended to increase a cyclist's visibility, 
especially at night. improving a cyclist's intent and interaction with other road users, such as 
vehicles and pedestrians.

Safety might be significantly improved with Light Vest, especially for those who ride at night.
